Welcome!

I've created a website from the ground-up!

While I'm happy with the current responsive design, I'm looking to apply new techniques and skills as I develop them. With that said, I'm always looking to tweak elements, attributes, functionality and other miscellaneous items. In this way, it's a sort of practice ground with which I can keep a portfolio of my work, but also try NEW THINGS!

One of the great things about this is that I get to present my work to github! There's a lot of time and effort that's been devoted to this project, but I've found inspiration and suggestions all across the web (without which this site would be much more simplistic). With that being said, I'm hosting these files publicly in hopes that other web developers may take some inspiration or find answers to their own questions!
