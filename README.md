# Web-Site
Welcome to jonhagen.com!

I've created a website from the ground-up!

While I'm happy with the current responsive design, I'm looking to apply new techniques and skills as I develop them. With that said, I'm always looking to tweak elements, attributes, functionality and other miscellaneous items. In this way, it's a sort of practice ground with which I can keep a portfolio of my work, but also try NEW THINGS!
